Note: This compares the column ERINCOME in ehresp_2014.csv with
the highest n of the same ID in ehact_2014.csv. ERIncome is a categorical
with 5 levels corresponding to how much a household is above the baseline level
for poverty in the United States so proc freq will be used often.

1 - Income > 185% of poverty threshold
2 - Income < = 185% of poverty threshold
3 - 130% of poverty threshold < Income < 185% of poverty threshold
4 - Income > 130% of poverty threshold
5 - Income <= 130% of poverty threshold

Limitations: Values in ERINCOME not integers (1,5) should be excluded since 
these contain non-valid data.

Question 2 of 3: Is there a relationship between BMI ERBMI column in

eating ehact_2014.csv?

Rationale: I've heard of conflicting reports between eating smaller meals, 
one large meal, or even fasting leading to lower BMI. Is there an observable 
pattern or relationship?

Note: This compares the column BMI ERBMI of ehresp_2014 with the highest value 
of tuactivity_n for the same ID in ehact_2014.csv.

Limitations: Values of bmi are only properly defined if the individual has
valid entries for height and weight that is EUHGT > 0 and EUWGT > 0.

Question 3 of 3: Do people who exercise at least once a week, column EUEXERCISE 
in enresp2014.csv, determine how often they eat, activity number of secondary 
eatings enhact_2014?

Rationale: Do people who exercise tend to engage in secondary eating? 
Once again I've heard conflicting accounts. Sometimes people who go to the gym 
claim they need to eat protein rich meal for muscle growth. And I heard 
nutritionists talk about calories in and calories out.

Note: This compares the column EUEXERCISE of enresp2014.csv with the highest 
value of tuactivity_n for the same ID in ehact_2014.csv. EUEXERCISE is a
categorical variable with entries 1 - Yes or 2 - No. So I will need to count
frequencies.

Limitations: Values of Exercise are limited to integer values 1 or 2. 1-
exercise besides work 2 - no exercise.
